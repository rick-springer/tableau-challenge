# Citibike Analysis In analysing and graphing the data, I noticed that Members are much more likely to use the Citibikes than casual users.Also, the end destinations have many more visits than the start locations. This tells me that starting locations need to be varied and many people from many areas will likely use Citibikes to travel to only a few destinations.People are much more likely to use Citibikes in Q3, probably because of weather and school.Also, peak hours mimic "rush hour" times for car traffic, following the standard work/school schedule.The most used type of Citibike is the classic bike.
